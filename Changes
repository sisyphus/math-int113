Changes file for Math::Int113

0.04
 - Allow negative values to be passed to bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~, >>, <<).
   These negative values will be converted to their 113-bit 2s-complement value
   prior to being acted upon by the bitwise operator - thus mimicking perl's
   treatment of negative 32-bit/64-bit IVs.
 - Add divmod() function.
 - Add new test file t/bitwise_feature.t

0.03
 - Overload '%' operation.
 - Disallow left shifts and right shifts of more than 112 places.
 - Add coverage() function.

0.02
 - Fix Makefile.PL to disallow builds on perls whose nvtype is the 80-bit
   extended precision long double.

 - Alter the allowed range of values from:
   -10384593717069655257060992658440192 .. 10384593717069655257060992658440192
   to:
   -10384593717069655257060992658440191 .. 10384593717069655257060992658440191
   This is done because +/-1038...193 is also assigned as +/-1038...192.

 - Handle NaN.
